The new cell phone rule by the law I really really really hate it. There are people out there need there cell phones like people who are artistic people who need it has like food tracking heart, drinking enough water thru out the day. But the reason why they banned cell phone law is because chat gpt and cheat off on test, work, and star test. I want them to get rid of it because number 1 I don't feel safe in this school there are dangerous people that I seen and met before I usually ingore them. Number 2 what if I had to stay after school how can I call my parents if I needed to stay after school. Number 3 what if something bad has happen to me the only way people have my location is on my phone so my parents know where I'm at. Number 4 people should trust me with my phone out I don't cheat all I want to do is text my dad that I'm ok and nothing bad has happen to me. Number 5 I need my phone because why not. I'm done with my 5 reasons.

IKEA partnered with the game platform Roblox to launch "The Co-Worker Game," a virtual store where players can perform jobs like restocking shelves and serving food for real pay, including the rate of $16.10 per hour in some instances. This initiative, part of IKEA's "Careers Done Different" campaign, blurs the lines between digital and real-world employment, acting as both a marketing tool and an experiment to explore new forms of digital labor and brand engagement, particularly with younger audiences. The Co-Worker Game: IKEA's Roblox venture is a gamified experience that simulates a real-life IKEA store.
Virtual Jobs: Players can take on roles like stocking shelves, designing showrooms, serving food in the Bistro, and assisting customers. Paid Positions: IKEA actually hired and paid individuals to work in these virtual roles at a rate of $16.10 per hour in some cases, creating real-world income for digital work. 
Employment Standards: To comply with employment standards and ensure real wages, these paid roles were primarily open to adults in the UK and Ireland.

The phrase "6, 7" is mostly meaningless, a nonsensical inside joke that spread through TikTok. Its origin traces back to a viral rap song, and some memes also connect it to basketball player LaMelo Ball's height. Students use it to indicate something is "so-so" or simply as a playful, random interjection in class or hallways. The moody fun is in the shared, absurd reference, often accompanied by a hand motion. It is meant to be funny and confusing to adults. Students repeat it because it signifies belonging to an online youth culture. All of this is just a meme 6 7!

I would allow phones Ai because it's better than a regular teacher but it's not only for answers it can teach you a easy way of teaching you and I would unbocked all the games because im that one person and every dosen't have a chance to either play games when they get home. I'm gonna add an hour for lunch time. No more Math and No more staar testing,no more homework and give us easy work. Band I have nothing to say for that because it's easy and fun and I also have nothing to say in this class because it's fun.
