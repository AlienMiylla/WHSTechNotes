The new cell phone rule by the law I really really really hate it. There are people out there need there cell phones like people who are artistic people who need it has like food tracking heart, drinking enough water thru out the day. But the reason why they banned cell phone law is because chat gpt and cheat off on test, work, and star test. I want them to get rid of it because number 1 I don't feel safe in this school there are dangerous people that I seen and met before I usually ingore them. Number 2 what if I had to stay after school how can I call my parents if I needed to stay after school. Number 3 what if something bad has happen to me the only way people have my location is on my phone so my parents know where I'm at. Number 4 people should trust me with my phone out I don't cheat all I want to do is text my dad that I'm ok and nothing bad has happen to me. Number 5 I need my phone because why not. I'm done with my 5 reasons.
